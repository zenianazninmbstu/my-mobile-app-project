### 📦 JSON Data
Create 10-15 technology data with:
- id
- name
- category (Frontend / Backend / Database / Language / Styling / DevOps / Tools)
- description
- icon (image URL)
- rating (example: 4.8)
- difficulty (Beginner-Friendly / Intermediate / Advanced)
- badge (example: Popular, Fast, Essential, Containers)

**Example:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "react",
    "name": "React",
    "category": "Frontend",
    "description": "A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building modern user interfaces.",
    "icon": "https://icon.icepanel.io/Technology/svg/React.svg",
    "rating": 4.9,
    "difficulty": "Beginner-Friendly",
    "badge": "Popular"
  },
  {
    "id": "postgresql",
    "name": "PostgreSQL",
    "category": "Database",
    "description": "A powerful, open-source object-relational database system with proven reliability.",
    "icon": "https://icon.icepanel.io/Technology/svg/PostgresSQL.svg",
    "rating": 4.9,
    "difficulty": "Intermediate",
    "badge": "Top SQL"
  }
]
```

🚩 You can take help of AI Systems for generating the JSON Data.

🚩 Load the data from the JSON file — do not hardcode the array inside the component.

### 🃏 Technology Cards
- Display all technologies in a 3-column layout (responsive: 1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet).
- Each card includes:
  - Icon
  - Badge
  - Name
  - Description
  - Category chip
  - Difficulty
  - Rating with a star
  - "Add to Stack" button

---

### 🧰 Your Stack Section (Sidebar)
- A "Your Stack" panel sits beside the technology grid.
- Shows a heading and the selected count — example: "2 Technology Selected".
- By default the panel shows an empty message.

| Empty state | With selected items |
| --- | --- |
| ![Your Stack empty](./ui/YourStack-without.png) | ![Your Stack with items](./ui/YourStack-with.png) |

---

### ➕ Add to Stack Functionality
- Clicking "Add to Stack" adds that technology to the "Your Stack" panel.
- Each stack item shows: icon, name, category, and a remove (✕) button.
- Stack layout: 1 column.
- **The same technology cannot be added twice.** Trying again shows a warning alert.

- Once added, that card's button becomes disabled and reads "✓ Added to Stack".

---

### ❌ Remove Functionality
- Clicking the ✕ button on a stack item removes only that item from the stack.
- "Remove All" button clears the whole stack at once.

---

### 🦶 Footer
- Footer designed based on the UI.
- Brand block: logo, name, short description, social links (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn).
- Three link groups: Product, Company, Legal.
- Bottom bar: copyright text + Privacy and Terms links.

---

### 📱 Responsive Design
- Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Follow standard responsive practices.

---

# 🚀 Challenges Part (10 Marks)

### 🔔 Use a NPM Package React-Toastify
- Use react-toastify to show alerts for: add to stack, duplicate add attempt, remove, and remove all.

---

### ⏳ Loading State
- Show a loading message/spinner while the JSON data is being fetched.
- Note: since the JSON is a local file, the loading state may only be visible for a few milliseconds and can be hard to catch on screen. That is completely fine — the requirement is that the loading state exists and works, not that it stays visible for long.

---

### 🎨 Gradient Brand Theme
- Use one shared gradient (orange → pink → violet) for the brand name, hero heading highlight, and primary buttons.
- Define the gradient in one place so the whole UI can be re-themed by changing a single value.

---

### 📂 GitHub Repository
- Create a beautiful GitHub Readme with the following description:
  - Name of your project
  - A little description
  - Technology that you use
  - 3 features about your project

- Also answer these React questions at the end of your Readme (write the answers in your own words, short and simple):
  1. What is JSX, and why is it used in React?
  2. What is the difference between props and state?
  3. What does the `useState` hook do, and where did you use it in this project?
  4. What does the `useEffect` hook do, and why did you need it to load the JSON data?
  5. Why does every item in a `.map()` list need a unique `key` prop?
  6. What is conditional rendering? Show one place you used it (example: the empty stack message).
  7. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component, and how does a child send something back to the parent?

## ❓ Common FAQ

**1. Where can we deploy the site?**  
Anywhere you like — Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any other host. There is no fixed platform.

**2. Do we have to use TypeScript?**  
No. You can use TypeScript or JavaScript. If you want to build the whole project in plain JavaScript, that is completely fine.

**3. Can we change the title, logo, and colors?**  
Yes. The project title, logo, and color scheme are all yours to change — just keep them relevant to the project. Don't use random or gobindo colors and don't put an unrelated title/logo.

**4. Where do we get the technology logos/icons?**  
You can use image URLs from Google or from anywhere you like. A good source with clean, ready-to-use tech logos is <https://techicons.dev/> — copy the icon URL from there and put it in your JSON data.
